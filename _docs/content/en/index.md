Craft CMS is intuitive. Marketing plans and organizational workflows—not so much. Guide lets you create a user manual throughout Craft CMS so clients don‘t need to go far to get the answers they need.

Guide was built to be a CMS manual, but Guide 3 is also a quick way to create widgets and unique Craft CP pages, without the use of a custom module or the need for PHP.

## Requirements

- This plugin requires Craft CMS 3.7 or later.
- An evergreen browser that support CSS `aspect-ratio`.


## Editions

The PRO edition of Guide includes a code editor and Twig components that make it easy to place helpful information around the Craft CMS Control Panel (standalone CP pages, widgets, UI elements, and any CP URL you specify).

The LITE edition is offered for developers who prefer to write their own guide templates and to display them in the Guide CP section.
