Craft CMS is intuitive. Marketing plans and organizational workflows‚Äînot so much. Guide lets you create a user manual throughout Craft CMS so clients don‚Äòt need to go far to get the answers they need.

Guide was built to be a CMS manual, but Guide 3 is also a quick way to create widgets and unique Craft CP pages, without the use of a custom module or knowledge of PHP.
